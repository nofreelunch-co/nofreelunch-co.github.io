## Development

To start full-stack full app development (frontend, backend, database, ... running) run the following in your terminal:
```sh
> cd app
> npm i
> npm run dev
```

To:
- perform component development via `storybook`,
- run `test`s,
- run `lint`ing,
- see how to get a debugger with breakpoints running

or execute further, other commands, please have a look at the more detailed [readme of the fullstack app](./app/README.md).
